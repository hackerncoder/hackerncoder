**hackerncoder/hackerncoder** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Iâ€™m currently helping with Invidous, contain-google and a little over at Qubes.
- Iâ€™m currently learning Python.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything not too code heavy
